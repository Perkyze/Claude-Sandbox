## Psychographics

### Pain Points (What Keeps Them Up at Night)
- **No website** or outdated site (built 5+ years ago, not mobile-friendly)
- **Low visibility** on Google (competitors rank higher for local searches)
- **Manual booking** (phone calls, no online reservation system)
- **Poor mobile experience** (site breaks on phones, high bounce rate)
- **Can't update site themselves** (depends on expensive developer for small changes)
- **No online presence** (missing out on Instagram/Google Maps traffic)

### Goals & Motivations
- **Get more customers** from Google and social media
- **Look professional** (compete with bigger brands in their area)
- **Save time** (reduce phone calls with online booking/forms)
- **Be findable** (rank on Google Maps for "[service] + [city]")
- **Control their brand** (update content, photos, menu without developer)

### Objections & Fears
- **"It's too expensive"** (seen $10k+ quotes from agencies)
- **"Takes too long"** (heard horror stories of 3-6 month timelines)
- **"I'll need to hire someone to manage it"** (don't want ongoing tech dependency)
- **"I already have Instagram, why do I need a site?"** (don't see value)
- **"I'm not tech-savvy"** (worried they can't update it)

## Budget Signals (How to Identify "Good Fit" Leads)

### Green Flags (Strong Buying Signals)
- ✅ **Active on Instagram** (500-5k followers, posts 2-3x/week)
- ✅ **Google Business Profile** with reviews (30+ reviews, responds to customers)
- ✅ **Professional branding** (logo, consistent colors, quality photos)
- ✅ **Busy business** (packed reservation times, lines out the door, active social comments)
- ✅ **Owner-operated** (decision-maker is accessible, not corporate hierarchy)
- ✅ **Recent renovation or expansion** (invested in physical space = will invest in digital)
- ✅ **Runs ads** (Facebook, Instagram, Google = understands marketing value)

### Red Flags (Avoid or Deprioritize)
- ❌ **Brand new business** (<1 year old, unstable revenue)
- ❌ **Franchise or chain** (needs corporate approval, long sales cycle)
- ❌ **No social media presence** (no Instagram, Facebook inactive = low digital maturity)
- ❌ **Very small budget** ("I can only spend $500")
- ❌ **DIY mindset** ("My nephew can build it for free")
- ❌ **Large company** (20+ employees, in-house marketing team)
- ❌ **English-only** (you target French-speaking Québec clients)
